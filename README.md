If you would like to help with developing the app please contact areopagitics@gmail.com. There is some simple non-programming work that could be done, like updating databases with special day liturgy readings (i.e. Holy Week, Easter...). See below for more instructions.

For the Apple (iOS, iphone) or Windows Phone versions which could be pretty easy to make, consider paying for the Developers fee:

Apple charges $99 USD/year 

Microsoft $19 only once

TODO LIST

- add Bible pages
- link readings to the Bible chapters
- add special days to the liturgical calendar - Easter, Holy Week, etc: save the csv file at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Areopagitics/Daily-Scrolls/master/databases/USCCB/Mass%20Readings%202017-EWTN%20website.csv and add columns for missing readings (ThirdReading, SecondPsalm, FourthReading, ...)

If you would like to help with developing the app please contact areopagitics@gmail.com. There is some simple non-programming work that could be done, like updating databases with special day liturgy readings (i.e. Holy Week, Easter...) - currently only 5 of the liturgical readings are supported per day: First, Psalm, Second, Acclamation (still waiting for clean version), Gospel. See below for more instructions.

For the Apple (iOS, iphone) or Windows Phone versions which could be pretty easy to make, consider paying for the for the Developers fee:

Apple charges $99 USD/year
Microsoft $19 only once

``adblockparser`` is a package for working with `Adblock Plus`_ filter rules.
It can parse Adblock Plus filters and match URLs against them.

.. _Adblock Plus: https://adblockplus.org

Installation
------------

::

    pip install adblockparser

Python 2.7 and Python 3.3+ are supported.

If you plan to use this library with a large number of filters
installing pyre2_ library is highly recommended: the speedup
for a list of default EasyList_ filters can be greater than 1000x.

    pip install 're2 >= 0.2.21'

Note that pyre2 library requires C++ re2_ library installed.
On OS X you can get it using homebrew (``brew install re2``).

.. _re2: https://github.com/google/re2
.. _pyre2: https://github.com/axiak/pyre2
.. _EasyList: https://easylist.to/

Usage
-----

To learn about Adblock Plus filter syntax check these links:

* https://adblockplus.org/en/filter-cheatsheet
* https://adblockplus.org/en/filters


1. Get filter rules somewhere: write them manually, read lines from a file
   downloaded from EasyList_, etc.::

       >>> raw_rules = [
       ...     "||ads.example.com^",
       ...     "@@||ads.example.com/notbanner^$~script",
       ... ]

2. Create ``AdblockRules`` instance from rule strings::

       >>> from adblockparser import AdblockRules
       >>> rules = AdblockRules(raw_rules)

3. Use this instance to check if an URL should be blocked or not::

       >>> rules.should_block("http://ads.example.com")
       True

   Rules with options are ignored unless you pass a dict with options values::

       >>> rules.should_block("http://ads.example.com/notbanner")
       True
       >>> rules.should_block("http://ads.example.com/notbanner", {'script': False})
       False
       >>> rules.should_block("http://ads.example.com/notbanner", {'script': True})
       True

Consult with Adblock Plus `docs <https://adblockplus.org/en/filters#options>`__
for options description. These options allow to write filters that depend
on some external information not available in URL itself.

Performance
-----------

Regex engines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``AdblockRules`` class creates a huge regex to match filters that
don't use options. pyre2_ library works better than stdlib's re
with such regexes. If you have pyre2_ installed then ``AdblockRules``
should work faster, and the speedup can be dramatic - more than 1000x
in some cases.

Sometimes pyre2 prints something like
``re2/dfa.cc:459: DFA out of memory: prog size 270515 mem 1713850`` to stderr.
Give re2 library more memory to fix that::

    >>> rules = AdblockRules(raw_rules, use_re2=True, max_mem=512*1024*1024)  # doctest: +SKIP

Make sure you are using re2 0.2.20 installed from PyPI, it doesn't work.

Parsing rules with options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rules that have options are currently matched in a loop, one-by-one.
Also, they are checked for compatibility with options passed by user:
for example, if user didn't pass 'script' option (with a ``True`` or ``False``
value), all rules involving ``script`` are discarded.

This is slow if you have thousands of such rules. To make it work faster,
explicitly list all options you want to support in ``AdblockRules`` constructor,
disable skipping of unsupported rules, and always pass a dict with all options
to ``should_block`` method::

    >>> rules = AdblockRules(
    ...    raw_rules,
    ...    supported_options=['script', 'domain'],
    ...    skip_unsupported_rules=False
    ... )
    >>> options = {'script': False, 'domain': 'www.mystartpage.com'}
    >>> rules.should_block("http://ads.example.com/notbanner", options)
    False

This way rules with unsupported options will be filtered once, when
``AdblockRules`` instance is created.

Limitations
-----------

There are some known limitations of the current implementation:

* element hiding rules are ignored;
* matching URLs against a large number of filters can be slow-ish,
  especially if pyre2_ is not installed and many filter options are enabled;
* ``match-case`` filter option is not properly supported (it is ignored);
* ``document`` filter option is not properly supported;
* rules are not validated *before* parsing, so invalid rules may raise
  inconsistent exceptions or silently work incorrectly.

It is possible to remove all these limitations. Pull requests are welcome
if you want to make it happen sooner!

Changes
=======

0.7 (2016-10-17)
----------------

* Fixed parsing issue with recent easylist.txt;
* fixed a link to easylist (thanks https://github.com/limonte).

0.6 (2016-09-10)
----------------

* Added support for regex rules (thanks https://github.com/mlyko).

0.5 (2016-03-04)
----------------

* Fixed an issue with blank lines in filter files
  (thanks https://github.com/skrypka);
* fixed an issue with applying rules with 'domain' option
  when domain doesn't have a dot (e.g. 'localhost');
* Python 2.6 and Python 3.2 support is dropped;
  adblockparser likely still work in these interpreters,
  but this is no longer checked by tests.

0.4 (2015-03-29)
----------------

* AdblockRule now caches the compiled regexes (thanks
  https://github.com/mozbugbox);
* Fixed an issue with "domain" option handling
  (thanks https://github.com/nbraem for the bug report and a test case);
* cleanups and test improvements.

0.3 (2014-07-11)
----------------

* Switch to setuptools;
* better ``__repr__`` for ``AdblockRule``;
* Python 3.4 support is confirmed;
* testing improvements.

0.2 (2014-03-20)
----------------

This release provides much faster `AdblockRules.should_block()` method
for rules without options and rules with 'domain' option.

* better combined regex for option-less rules that makes re2 library
  always use DFA without falling back to NFA;
* an index for rules with domains;
* ``params`` method arguments are renamed to ``options`` for consistency.

0.1.1 (2014-03-11)
------------------

By default ``AdblockRules`` autodetects re2 library and uses
it if a compatible version is detected.

0.1 (2014-03-03)
----------------

Initial release.
